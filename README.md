# Visualization-the-sounds-of-day-to-day-objects
This repository contents different kind of sounds which we experience in our day to day life.Sound including 
Fan,Metal dish,Metal collision,Metal keys,Water splash,Water tap,Electric switch clicking,Wooden furniture 
collision,Mixer grinder etc etc.All those sounds are recorded in true environment that's why there is 
background noise with every sound.This dataset is free to download &amp; use,Anyone wanted to visualize 
their ML model or just wanted to visualize the sounds can use it.All those sounds are in WAV format for zero loss.
You can also check my IPYTHON notebook to get some idea about Audio visualization.

  ##Requirments
   You should have Python3 installed in your system.
   You have to downloads Numpy,Matplotlib-Pyplot,Librosa 
   
   ##What is Sampling and Sampling frequency?
      In signal processing, sampling is the reduction of a continuous signal into a series of discrete values. 
      The sampling frequency or     rate is the number of samples taken over some fixed amount of time. A high 
      sampling frequency results in less information loss but higher computational expense, and low sampling 
      frequencies have higher information loss but are fast and cheap to compute.
      
   ##Sound is represented in the form of an audio signal having parameters such as frequency, bandwidth, decibel,
    etc. A typical audio signal can be expressed as a function of Amplitude and Time.
   
   ##Spectrogram
         A spectrogram is a visual way of representing the signal strength, or “loudness”, of a signal over 
         time at various frequencies present in a particular waveform. Not only can one see whether there is 
         more or less energy at, for example, 2 Hz vs 10 Hz, but one can also see how energy levels vary over time.
   
   ##Zero-Crossing Rate
          A very simple way for measuring the smoothness of a signal is to calculate the number of zero-crossing
          within a segment of that signal. A voice signal oscillates slowly — for example, a 100 Hz signal will 
          cross zero 100 per second — whereas an unvoiced fricative can have 3000 zero crossings per second.
    
    ##Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients(MFCCs)
          The Mel frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) of a signal are a small set of features 
          (usually about 10–20) which concisely describe the overall shape of a spectral envelope. 
          It models the characteristics of the human voice. 
          
     ##Chroma feature
           A chroma feature or vector is typically a 12-element feature vector indicating how much energy
           of each pitch class, {C, C#, D, D#, E, …, B}, is present in the signal. In short, It provides 
           a robust way to describe a similarity measure between music pieces.
